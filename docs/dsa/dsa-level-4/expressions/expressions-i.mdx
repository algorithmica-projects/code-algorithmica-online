# Experiments with Expressions-I Level 4

We ususally form algebraic equations while solving computational problems. Expression support in a programming language helps us
to communicate those algebraic equations to computing machines. 

Expressions consists of variables, literals & operators. The language also defines the order of evaluation of those expressions 
using precedence and associativity rules. You can also assign the result of expression to a variable if required. 

In this section, we will solve basic computational problems using expressions involving integer arithmetic.
