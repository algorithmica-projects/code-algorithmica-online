# Basics 2

Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
It is used for:
web development (server-side),
software development,

We highly recommend that you start migrating to v2, as v1 will eventually be
discontinued. However, rest assured that support for v1 will still be provided
for the near future.

## Whatâ€™s new
